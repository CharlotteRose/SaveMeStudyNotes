example for problem statement :

Configure a null client for Postfix mail server on myserver.domain.com. Your client will need to relay mail through elayhost.com, using client.domain.com as the domain name on outgoing email.

vim /usr/share/doc/postfix/readme/STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_FILE   #file containing examples for postfix configurations  
  > relayhost mailrelayhost.domain.com   #specify where messages should be routed to 
  > inet_interfaces loopback-only   #ensure that postfix is listening on loopback only 
  > myorigin = client.domain.com   #fqdn we want mail to be shown it is being sent by
  > mydestination   #goes nowhere so leave it blank 
  > local_transport "error: local devilery disabled"    #share error msg stating locla delivery is diabled 
  > mynetworks  127.0.0.0/8 [::1]/128 #limit messages forwarded to mailrelayhost with network specifications 
systemctl restart postfix   #restart services to ensure persistence
